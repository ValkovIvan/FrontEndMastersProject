Please add all the to do items/ideas here:

1. AJAX - requesting data from server without refreshing the page. Like when you scrol the list and there is a button to load more. When you click on it you get an extra amount of items, etc.
2. I need to add some kind of site visitor tracking: IP, date/time, and maybe convert it into something readable
3. Add some sort of delay handling, like spinners.
4. What security features do I need to add? TBC
5. Add tests to my project
6. Add dropdowns
7. Add visual effects
